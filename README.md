# Jic-tac-toe with Minimax Algorithm

A Java implementation of Tic-tac-toe featuring an unbeatable opponent using the Minimax algorithm.

## Features

- **Unbeatable algorithm**: The bot uses the Minimax algorithm to make optimal moves
- **Clean Interface**: Simple console-based gameplay with clear board visualization
- **Error Handling**: Robust input validation with graceful error handling
- **Flexible Gameplay**: Choose to go first or second, select your symbol (X/O)

## How to Play

1. **Compile the game**:
   ```bash
   javac -d bin src/*.java
   ```

2. **Run the game**:
   ```bash
   java -cp bin App
   ```

3. **Follow the prompts**:
   - TLDR : Just read the propmpts, they are surrounded by trycatch so even if you go wrong, it wont hurt
   - Choose whether to go first or second
   - Select your symbol (X or O)
   - Enter your name
   - Play by entering numbers 1-9 corresponding to board positions

## Game Rules

Standard tic-tac-toe rules apply. **Spoiler alert**: You can never win! The minimax algorithm ensures the bot will either win or force a draw every single time.

## Some Details

- **Language**: Java
- **Algorithm**: Minimax with optimal move selection
- **Architecture**: Object-oriented design with separate classes for game logic, board management, and AI

*Note: I wanna add GUI features later, for now this CLI implementation exhausted my soul* 🫂

## Feedback

I'm open to criticism and suggestions! This project took longer than expected to implement the minimax algorithm correctly, and I'm always looking to improve. Feel free to reach out with any feedback, bug reports, or feature suggestions.

Looking to collaborate on interesting projects and always open to learning new things! Let's connect and build something awesome together. 🙏
